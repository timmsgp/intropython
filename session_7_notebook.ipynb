Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n\nCompared with other programming languages, Pythonâ€™s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.","metadata":{},"id":"08aa4b0c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Working with an object","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"902365df"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Making an object","metadata":{},"id":"d773f17d-fdc1-40d2-9fc1-82fddffcf346"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Simple class","metadata":{},"id":"4e6ae9ef-a4e5-4091-8b42-0eb36e04eb20"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class MyClass:\n    \"\"\"A simple example class\"\"\"\n    i = 12345      # i for a generic integer\n\n    def f(self):   # f for a generic function\n        return 'hello world'","metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[],"id":"5c485991-5ad7-499f-91cc-9d79742eb3b1"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Class instantiation","metadata":{},"id":"cf8861aa-674e-4d5b-8cf8-100bdd24408c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x = MyClass()","metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[],"id":"de11aba9-8078-4db1-9d98-a5456a58f7b9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Print the class","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"02d1b5e1-f2ad-49e3-a83d-2ddc03d30a84"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(x)","metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"<__main__.MyClass object at 0x0000018F5DDF4B80>\n"}],"id":"7ad5fd25-0721-4c74-8cae-d725a551b540"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Print a variable in the class","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"474f32e9-94a9-4923-9538-d528246d9e4f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(x.i)","metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"12345\n"}],"id":"967cdea0-3585-4c2f-87fa-afdedae268e8"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Run a function from the class object","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"733b04b8-5370-48ba-b73b-89e356fc59f5"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x.f()","metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'hello world'"},"metadata":{}}],"id":"1f44130d-a369-416e-8a7a-23c203d0d8c5"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A blank class instance -
