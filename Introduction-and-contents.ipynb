This Jupyter Notebook lives in a GitHub repository and is read by Binder to deliver it to you in a web browser as a fully functional Python instance. That way you don't have to install anything on your machine.\n\nKey things to note:\n1. You can interact with this notebook without fear of damaging the main files. Whatever you do is temporary.\n2. Code in many cells is dependent upon previous cells being successfully run.\n3. Nothing you do is permanent. If you leave the binder instance, the notebook will default to its original settings and content.\n4. You can save and export notebook content in various formats to preserve your work. If you are working on a challenge and need to return to it later, export the notebook (File -> Export) as HTML. Then you can copy and paste any code you've written back into the notebook when you restart it.","metadata":{},"id":"3b9ad5e9-c63e-46fa-ba15-886b5608cdd5"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Troubleshooting the Binder","metadata":{},"id":"8b541471-0cd5-4e9c-9190-10e27522fdb2"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If we don't interact with our Jupyter Notebook on Binder, the Kernel may be dropped. We can see our 'ipykernel' in the top right hand corner of the window. If the kernel stops, click on it and choose the Python 3 kernel.\n\nIMPORTANT! If the kernel is stopped and restarted, the notebook will forget that you have run any code cells. So you may need to backtrack and run code cells if other cells are dependent upon variables set in the preceding code.\n\nOccasionally the binder connection fails. Unfortunately, this means we need to reload everything.
