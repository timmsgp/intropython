This Jupyter Notebook lives in a GitHub repository and is read by Binder to deliver it to you in a web browser as a fully functional Python instance. That way you don't have to install anything on your machine.\n\nKey things to note:\n1. You can interact with this notebook without fear of damaging the main files. Whatever you do is temporary.\n2. Code in many cells is dependent upon previous cells being successfully run.\n3. Nothing you do is permanent. If you leave the binder instance, the notebook will default to its original settings and content.\n4. You can save and export notebook content in various formats to preserve your work. If you are working on a challenge and need to return to it later, export the notebook (File -> Export) as HTML. Then you cna copy and paste any code you've written back into the notebook when you restart it.","metadata":{},"id":"3b9ad5e9-c63e-46fa-ba15-886b5608cdd5"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Course Contents","metadata":{},"id":"3eed4a60-4631-4d93-9242-3816e581bf22"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* [Session 1 - Data Types and Data Structures](session_1_notebook.ipynb)\n* [Session 2 - Iterating (Getting Content from Iterables Like Lists and Dictionaries)](session_2_notebook.ipynb)\n* [Session 3 - User Defined Functions](session_3_notebook.ipynb)\n* [Session 4 - Working with CSV Files](session_4_notebook.ipynb)\n* [Session 5 - Searching for Data in Data Structures and Matching Patterns in Data](session_5_notebook.ipynb)\n* [Session 6 - ]()\n* [Session n - ]()","metadata":{},"id":"a6101a55-bee0-4dcc-9175-99d71f24a96f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Resources","metadata":{},"id":"3b887f80-135e-4a0a-9d80-5760593fc005"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"cffabfda-9a72-4db3-aab6-4a2d05e3b3af"}]}
