    "3. Nothing you do is permanent. If you leave the binder instance, the notebook will default to its original settings and content.\n",
    "4. You can save and export notebook content in various formats to preserve your work. If you are working on a challenge and need to return to it later, export the notebook (File -> Export) as HTML. Then you cna copy and paste any code you've written back into the notebook when you restart it."
